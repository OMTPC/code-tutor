                          Explanation: Variables are like containers that hold values. These values can be numbers, text, or other types of data. 
                          You can also perform operations with them, like printing their value or doing basic calculations.
                          1.	Declare three variables:
                            age: store an integer value, e.g., 25.
                            name: store a string value, e.g., "Alice".
                            height: store a floating-point number, e.g., 5.6.
                          2.	Print each of these variables to the console""",
