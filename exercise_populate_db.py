Description: This script adds exercises and their respective solutions to the Code Mentor database. It is used to populate 
the database with initial data, specifically for Module 1: Variables & Data Types.

Usage: Run the script as a standalone file to populate the database.

Resources: Please refer to References.txt for the resources used to build this application.

                          You can also perform operations with them, like printing their value or doing basic calculations.

                            age: store an integer value, e.g., 25.
